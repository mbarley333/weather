# Weather Client

A simple command line utility to query the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather Data API

```bash
./weather -location Seattle -units imperial
{Clouds few clouds 81.86 Seattle}
```

## Goals
To learn and become more familiar with the following aspects of the Go language:
* testing
* functions and methods
* structs
* HTTP clients
* writing clear code

## Future enhancements
* output in human friendly format (e.g. Your current weather is clear skies, wind at 10 mph and a tempurature of 78.0 ÂºF)
* add more data elements to output
* use weather client as part of a UI project
* use weather client as part of a HTTP server project that uses concurrency
